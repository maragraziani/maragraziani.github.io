    <h1><a href="./">Hi, I am Mara!</a></h1>
    <h2>My name is Mara Graziani and I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Geneva. My main interests focus on Deep learning interpretability for medical imaging. I am keen at finding clues in deep neural networks which could improve the trust of clinicians in deep learning approaches to medical tasks.

As a master student, I read for a MPhil in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at the University of Cambrdige. My master thesis aimed at improving interpretability and generalization for deep learning on natural language processing tasks.
